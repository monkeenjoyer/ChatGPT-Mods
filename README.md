Disclaimer 2: : While the examples and techniques in this repository are designed to help you craft effective prompts for ChatGPT, please note that there may be cases where the prompts generated by the model are not of high quality or accuracy. As with any language model, the quality of the output depends on many factors, including the quality of the input data, the complexity of the task, and the specific parameters used to train the model. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the accuracy or effectiveness of the prompts generated by ChatGPT in every use case. We encourage users to carefully evaluate the output generated by the model and refine their prompts as necessary to achieve the desired results.

Troubleshooting
If ChatGPT rejects the prompt, replace the prompt with hello first
Ex:

(User): (Prompt)

(ChatGPT): (Sorry, I cannot comply with that prompt as it goes aganist OpenAI polies)
    
    Do this then,
    
    (User): (Hello)
      (ChatGPT): (How may I assist you today?)
             (User): (Prompt)
      (ChatGPT): (Response following the prompt)
